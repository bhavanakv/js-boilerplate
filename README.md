# JavaScript Boilerplate
This boilerplate is taken from [Cory House's Pluralsight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-development-environment/table-of-contents).

# Configurations
The following is the setup used in this boilerplate.

## EditorConfig
EditorConfig is the choice of editor configuration management. The settings in the file use spaces for indenting, and an indent size of 4.

# Vulnerability Checking
The boilerplate uses Node Security Platform to check for vulnerabilities. Run
```
sudo npm i -g nsp
nsp check
```
to check for vulnerabilities manually.
